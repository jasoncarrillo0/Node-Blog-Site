# Node-Blog-Site
This app was built using Node, Embedded JavaScript (EJS), MongoDB/Mongoose, and basic web technologies. I built this app taking an online bootcamp, and added some of my own customizations. Currently the site is deployed on Heroku at: https://blooming-coast-15087.herokuapp.com/. If you blog on it, say something nice ;)
